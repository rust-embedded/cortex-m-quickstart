# `cortex-m-quickstart`

This repository previously contained a template for building applications for
ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, but it has been deprecated and is no longer
maintained. The previous version can be seen in the git history.

Instead, we suggest using [app-template](github.com/knurling-rs/app-template),
or the getting started guide for whatever framework or HAL you are interested
in using.
